A Hololens app made to visualize Antarctic data for the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

The initial view is of the entire Antarctica continent, using the Bedmap2 model (Fretwell et al. 2013) as a 3D basemap over which we can overlay geophysical data using standard polar stereographic coordinates. The user also has a tagalong menu with a slider bar to increase the vertical exaggeration, select the ROSETTA flight layer, and also select the Ross Ice Shelf sub-region for more detailed viewing.

This image shows the Ross Ice Shelf sub-region, overlain with the ROSETTA flight paths (blue = radar+lidar, red = radar only)
